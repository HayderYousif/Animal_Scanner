# Animal_Scanner
Human/Animal/Empty camera trap sequence labeling

I recommend to copy the program shorcut into a folder and run it from that folder to keep your desktop clean.

# GUI:

1- Browse for your images folder. Note that the folder/subfolder name should not have space. The program will process the images and separate them into sequences.
You can click on a thumbnail to view the sequences.

2- Select detection method, if you have 3pic/trigger images, the recommended choice is 'Fast_Detection'. For 1pic/trigger images please select '1pic/trigger'.
You may select a specific sequence instead of 'ALL'.

3- The user can select the type of sequences to be saved in a separate folder. e.g, save only animal sequences.

4- The user can change a sequence type (e.g, 'Human' to 'Background').

5- The software saves a report with sequences like:
